# Welcome to my page!

My name is Xuesen Zhao, a first-year Biostatistics student at Columbia University School of Public Health. I graduated from Wake Forest University in May 2022, with a Bachelors of Science degree in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and a double major in statistics. 

This website listed most of the major academic and professional experiences I've had over the past years. Links to my [Github](https://github.com/Theonlyviper66), and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuesen-zhao/) could be found here as well as in the navigation bar.
