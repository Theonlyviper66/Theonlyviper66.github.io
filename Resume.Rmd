## Research Experience

**Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem**

*Research Assistant, Department of Immunology*

* Cleaned, visualized, and analyzed multivariate flow-cytometry data on over 1,000,000 cells using R
* Applied principal components method for dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering analysis
* Guided colleagues to construct an automated pipeline for anomaly detection using statistical metrics 
* Senior project & presentation; constructed a foundation for the group to continue the research on anomaly detection; reaffirmed the diagnostic potentials of the method for detecting cognitive decline in Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients

**Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai**

*Research Assistant, Department of Biomedical Engineering*

* Investigated potential treatments for ischemic stroke in murine models
* Calculated the sample size that caters to experimental designs, participated actively during meetings  
* Presented to the whole group on how to make statistical interpretations and test hypotheses; effectively improved the understandings of experiment design for group members with no statistical background   

## Competition Prize

**DataFest Competition, the American Statistical Association**

* Analyzed data from an educational game about drug abuse and STD prevention in 11-14 years old
* Collaborated as a team to clean highly complicated data containing over 1.5 million rows; applied machine learning methods including K-nearest means, random forest, and regression tree for modeling  
* Won first-place among the higher-level groups at Wake Forest University
* R scripts and analysis results were sent to the research group at Yale Center for Health & Learning Games for evaluation of the game and insights into designing a more engaging game interface
